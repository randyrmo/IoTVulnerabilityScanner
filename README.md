# IoTVulnerabilityScanner
## Introduction
An interactive IoT vulnerability scanner for detecting vulnerabilities in an enterprise network by scanning multiple communication protocols. The application scans through the given IP range, detects devices present on each IP and tries to log in into the IoT device by using the database given by the administrator. 

The app is meant for usage my an admin of the network who can detect such vulnerabilities and notify device owners insside the enterprise by email. (which is known whenever the IoT device would be configured to log in into the enterprise wireless network)

## Installation and Configuration
Clone the repository and run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

Open the file config.config and replace *host* and *port* parameters as per your requirements.
Cchange adminemail in currently as *networkadminemail* and the sender (iotscanner) email, password currently as *systemscanneremail* and *systemscannerpassword* to your own email addresses.

Run the web application by using the command : `python3 app.py` and open the link in your browser. 
The repository contains a database **iot.db** which can be re-initialised by deleting the database and running the script `python3 extensions.py`

## Features
### Log In
- Log in into the system by using admin credentials as {username: *admin*, password: *password*} by default (change if to be deployed)
- Register an admin

## Testing
For testing the code, we have used a Raspberry Pi 1B via Ethernet.
You can connect multiple IoT devices to the laptop network and run the application.
